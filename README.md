# Fictional E-Commerce Platform
A conceptual e-commerce application that I had to build for my Final Project of the Full Stack Development Academy at Rumos.

**Project Overview**

This project serves as a prototype for an online retail platform. It’s structured to showcase the integration of front-end and back-end technologies in building a cohesive web application.

**Technologies Used:**
- Front-End: HTML, CSS, JavaScript
- Back-End: C# with ASP.NET Core MVC
- Database: LocalDB via Entity Framework Core
- Version Control: Git

**Key Features:**
- User Authentication: Secure login and registration system.
- Product Management: Display and manage product listings.
- Shopping Cart: Add, remove, and update items in the cart.
- Responsive Design: Ensures usability across various devices.

**Getting Started:**
1. Clone the repository:
- git clone https://github.com/Eduard-02/Fictional-ecommerce-platform.git
2.	Open the solution file in Visual Studio.
3.	Apply EF Core migrations (if not already applied):
- Update-Database
4.	Run the application (IIS Express or dotnet run).

The app uses LocalDB, which is installed by default with Visual Studio. No external SQL Server setup is needed.
